                              1. Make your changes in your feature branch
                              2. Ensure your code follows our `[coding standards](#coding-standards)`
                              3. Add or update tests as necessary
                              4. Run the test suite to ensure everything passes
                              5. Update documentation if needed
                              6. Commit your changes with a descriptive message
                              7. Push your branch to your fork
                              8. Submit a pull request to the main repository

                              ## Pull Request Process

                              1. Ensure your PR description clearly describes the problem and solution
                              2. Include the relevant issue number if applicable
                              3. Update the README.md or documentation with details of changes if needed
                              4. The PR must pass all CI/CD checks before being merged
                              5. A maintainer will review your PR and may request changes
                              6. Once approved, a maintainer will merge your PR
